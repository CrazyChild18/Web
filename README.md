# Web

## Introduction
This is an exercise for a Web project.Designed for an algorithm sharing website.The website mainly shares the algorithm content I learned in college, and saves it as a record. 

In addition, the web page has also added user-oriented sharing and comment functions.So each user can share what they think is a great algorithm, and they can also comment on others' sharing. 

## Technology
- Flask framework
- Basic HTML, CSS and JS
- SQLite

## Issue
1. The user prompt function of each page is not perfect. When the user enters the wrong user name or password or clicks on the wrong file, the prompt may cause typographical error or reminder error.
2. The page layout needs to be improved

## Using
Before use, you need to deploy the local Venv virtual environment, and then start the web page to implement the Flask framework through the virtual environment.
